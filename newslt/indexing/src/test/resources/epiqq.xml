            <title>Tanzania President Demands Audit in Central Bank Workforce</title>
            <description>Tanzania President John Magufuli has ordered the head of the Bank of Tanzania to weed out “ghost” workers after demanding an audit of the 1,391 employee workforce and terminate those the bank deems redundant.


Magufuli&#39;s remarks came after he paid a surprise working visit to the bank headquarters in the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam.


He is also demanding an inquiry into suspected corruption in an estimated $424,565,107 the state owed to companies for various work done for the government.


Magufuli&#39;s says the payments should be suspended until the ministry of finance completes its investigations.&#160; Officials say the president wants to ensure corrupt people are not hiding behind “ghost” companies to steal public funds.


Local media quoted a statement released by the president’s office following Magufuli&#39;s unannounced visit to the central bank.&#160;


&quot;The president ordered [Bank of Tanzania] to immediately halt payments approved from the exchequer accounts, and instead these claims should be returned to the Ministry of Finance and Planning for verification ...&#160; As President Magufuli gave the directive, the Bank of Tanzania was in the process of making payments amounting to [$425 million] that had been approved by the finance ministry.”


Asahi Mwambene, the Tanzanian government spokesman, says President Magufuli is serious and committed to his promise to weed out corruption in the country.&#160; He also says there have been suspicions that the Bank of Tanzania has employees who might have gotten jobs there because of their connections to senior government officials.


This, he says is what the president wants to ensure is discontinued, in order to allow what he says are competent people to work in a bid to improve the lives of citizens in all public institutions.


Mwambene says Tanzanians have been making fun of those who are alleged to have gotten their jobs there because of their connections.


“The president has a list of workers and he had the knowledge that there are workers who appear on the list who happen not to be working in the bank.&#160; So he actually ordered the governor of the bank to ensure that he cleans up the ghost workers that appear on the list of those that work at the central bank …&#160; When the governor of the bank tried to [explain] the president because angry saying he knows everything and all the governor has to do is to take precaution and make sure he implements [investigation] to remove the ghost workers within the central bank,” said Mwambene.


“The good thing is the president did not give them an ultimatum, [but] all he said was you have to do it and for sure there is no option for the central bank governor.&#160; He will certainly have to do [the investigation].&#160; As the president rightly said there are some workers who are found not to be working at the central bank, but they still get their salaries.”


Critics say Magufuli&#39;s actions are just populist posturing to gain support from a majority of the population.&#160; They said his commitment to weed our graft is yet to have any impact, despite repeated promises. &#160;


Mwambene disagrees. He says since his election the president&#39;s actions are beginning to instill accountability in all government institutions.

Witnesses said the assailants wore hooded face masks and arrived on foot on the beach at the Southern Star hotel, which was full of foreign expatriates during the current heatwave in the city of about 80,000 people.</description>

            <title>Anticipation, Partisan Clashes Over Obama Supreme Court Pick</title>
            <description>At any moment, President Barack Obama could name his pick to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month.&#160; Reports from the White House say the president has narrowed his list of potential nominees as the vetting process enters a final phase – even as Senate Republicans insist they will not consider any jurist Obama chooses.


For weeks, rumors have swirled over who is and isn’t on the president’s list of candidates. When asked, Obama has offered few clues as to who he intends to pick.


“I want somebody who is an outstanding jurist, who has impeccable legal credentials, who by historical standards would not even be questioned as qualified for the court,” he said last week.


Senate Democrats are eager to end the suspense.


“As far as timing, we would like someone as soon as possible, but the vetting process has to be thorough,” said Senator Chuck Schumer.




Republicans want the president to forgo a nomination entirely.


“We know what kind of judicial activist this president puts on the Supreme Court,” said the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley.


With Obama in the last year of his presidency, Republicans want his successor to fill the vacancy.


“My constituents back in Texas and, I think, people at large do not want this lame-duck president tilting the ideological balance of the Supreme Court for a generation,” said Senator John Cornyn. “We are not going to take up the nominee.&#160; We will leave that to the next president, whoever he or she may be.”


Democrats are betting that blanket, pre-emptive Republican opposition to a Supreme Court pick will soften once a nominee emerges.


“It is going to get a lot harder for our Republican colleagues to keep up this obstruction when a nominee is chosen,” Schumer said. “When we have a real flesh-and-blood nominee, and we believe that nominee will be somebody the American people will feel will be a great addition to the Supreme Court, it’s going to be a lot harder for them to say ‘no’.”


Some are warning the partisan battle will have long term consequences for America’s judiciary.


“I regret it most because of the damage it does to the Supreme Court as an institution, by dragging it down into the muck and mire of partisan politics and the gridlock that the American people despise” said Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal.


And one Republican predicts his party will get a nominee even less to their liking if Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected president.


“She is going to pick somebody probably more liberal than President Obama is going to send over in a few days,” said Senator Lindsey Graham.


For now, Obama is promising only one thing: there will be a nominee.


&#160;“I am confident that whoever I select, among fair-minded people, will be viewed as an eminently qualified person, and it will then be up to Senate Republicans to decide whether they want to follow the Constitution,” the president said.


An arch-conservative, Scalia’s judicial philosophy was at odds with that of Obama’s.&#160; His replacement could determine the Supreme Court’s ideological tilt for a generation.

            <title>Blast Rocks Turkish Capital, Killing at Least 27</title>
            <description>A large explosion ripped through the main square in Turkey&#39;s capital, Ankara, on Sunday, killing at least 27 people and wounding dozens more.


Officials said the blast occurred on Kizilay square, a key shopping and transportation hub near foreign embassies.


The NTV news channel said a car believed to be laden with explosives detonated near a bus. Several cars caught fire and television footage showed several gutted vehicles.




Dogan Asik, a bus passenger when the explosion occurred, said, “We were thrown further back into the bus from the force of the explosion.” Asik sustained injuries on his face and arm.


The blast comes less than a month after a car bomb attack in the capital killed at least 29 people.


Turkey said that attack was carried out by a Syrian man with links to Kurdish militia groups.


Ankara has been battling the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been fighting a 30-year guerrilla war for more Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey.


Turkey has also been targeted by Islamic State, which was blamed for last October&#39;s suicide bombing at a peace rally in Ankara that killed more than 100 people — the bloodiest single terrorist attack since Turkey became a modern state in 1923.

            <title>Cameroon: Victims of Boko Haram Insurgency Overwhelm Hospitals </title>
            <description>Cameroon said raids on Boko Haram strongholds along the country&#39;s northern border with Nigeria are taking a huge toll, with hospitals in the area overwhelmed by victims wounded during insurgency efforts, officials said.


Regional forces from Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Benin have been launching raids on the militants since last December.

The troops&#39; raids, as well as suicide bombings and landmines used by the insurgents have increased the number of victims.


The hospitals are suffering acute shortages of staff, medical equipment and infrastructure.


Hannah Lechantre, a French-born volunteer with the Cameroon medical council, said the Mora district hospital, with a capacity of 50 beds, now has 350 victims from Cameroon and Nigeria.


&#39;Very worrying&#39;


&quot;Actually, their health status and their mental status is very worrying. All these people, families, women, children have been hiding so long in the bush, eating nothing and drinking dirty water, so they arrive in Cameroon in very very bad situation in terms of health,&quot; Lechantre said.


Cameroon Health Minister Andre Mama Fouda said five hospitals, with a capacity of about 350, on the border with Nigeria are overcrowded with more than 1,700 victims being taken care of by about 400 staff members.


Fouda said the hospitals lack equipment and infrastructure to cope with the growing numbers and the hospitals are running short of supplies despite international efforts to assist.


Cameroon said more than 1,500 victims of Boko Haram atrocities died in hospitals on its northern border with Nigeria between January 2015 and March of this year.

            <title>16 Dead in Attack on Ivory Coast Beach Resort</title>
            <description>Six heavily armed assailants killed 14 civilians and two soldiers on Sunday in an attack on three hotels in the Ivory Coast beach resort of Grand-Bassam, before authorities say they “neutralized” the gunmen.


Witnesses said the assailants wore hooded face masks and arrived on foot on the beach at one of the hotels, the Southern Star, which was full of foreign expatriates during a heatwave in the city of about 80,000 people.


Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara put the death toll at 16.




A VOA reporter on the scene, Emilie Iob, said she saw at last six bodies lying on the ground. A witness she spoke to reported up to 10 shooting victims on the ground and one of the attackers shot dead.


The witness said four men shouted, “Allahu Akbar!” (God is great) before opening fire.

As the shooting rampage was unfolding, a hotel receptionist said, “We do not know where they came from, and we do not know where they have gone.”&#160; Everyone in the hotel was safe, he said, and police were on the scene.


Grand-Bassam is a former French colonial capital, about 40 kilometers east of the commercial hub of Abidjan, and is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of the elegant colonial-era facades of buildings in the city.




There was no immediate explanation for the attack. In recent months, Islamic jihadists have attacked luxury hotels in the capitals of neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, killing dozens of people.

            <title>UN: Peacekeeper Kills 2 Colleagues in Northern Mali</title>
            <description>A Chadian peacekeeper shot and killed two colleagues and wounded a third in an attack in northern Mali, the U.N. mission said Sunday.


A soldier was arrested in the shooting Saturday in Tassalit, in the Kidal region, U.N. spokeswoman Radhia Achouri said. She said there was no known motive to the shooting.


Achouri said an investigation is underway.


It is the second shooting incident in less than three weeks. On February 25 in Kidal, a soldier among the Chadian troops killed a commander and a doctor with the U.N. mission after weeks of tensions over living conditions and pay.




The U.N. mission in Mali was deployed in July 2013 to the country in an effort to oust Islamist militants who had taken over vast stretches of northern Mali. The mission has been one of the international group&#39;s deadliest peacekeeping missions.


The U.N. forces in northern Mali have come under frequent attack from militants.


In early February, militants struck a U.N. peacekeeping camp in Kidal, killing at least six peacekeepers and wounding 30 others. And in November 2015, militants struck a luxury hotel in the capital Bamako, which left 20 people dead.


About 2,000 Chadian soldiers have taken part in peacekeeping missiong. But in recent years, dozens of the Chadian troops have deserted over pay and living conditions.


Some material for this report came from AP and AFP.

            <title>Zambia Priests Plan to Meet Leaders Over Political Violence </title>
            <description>Zambia’s Episcopal Conference plans to meet with all political parties and their presidential candidates in a move to help curb politically motivated violence before the August 11 general election, according to Father Winfield Kunda, Communication director for the Catholic Media Services.


Zambians have expressed concern about clashes between supporters of political parties as the groups ready to begin official campaigning for the elections.


Local media organizations have often reported incidents of inter-party clashes often between the governing Patriotic Front (PF) and opposition parties including the United Party for National Development (UPND) and the Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD).


Meeting with bishops


Incumbent President Edgar Lungu, and main opposition leaders Hakainde Hichilema from the UPND and Nevers Mumba from the MMD have agreed to be part of the meeting with the Roman Catholic bishops.


Zambia is officially a Christian nation with a majority Christian population.


“Usually when the church being the moral voice calls for [these meetings] almost everyone comes on board. ... The three major presidential candidates are on board because in Zambia still the church commands a moral voice,” said Father Kunda.


He says the Catholic priests want to ensure the elections are not marred by violence that could threaten the country’s peace and stability.


“Really it’s this worry that the church has with regards to the forthcoming elections that we are witnessing spots of violence. And it’s all about reconciliation, unity, so that the electorate and different political groupings may tolerate each other as we edge towards the elections. So, it’s really talking to the leaders so that the leaders can inculcate in their cadres, the spirt of tolerance,” said Kunda.


Zambians say pronouncements of some politicians appear to be stoking the tension that they say is to blame for the inter-party clashes. They called on the political parties to take action against the politicians in order to prevent any election-related violence.


Tone down rhetoric


In an episcopal letter early this year about the state of the nation, the Catholic bishops urged the political party leaders to tone down their rhetoric before the elections. The bishops urged the politicians to ensure their supporters don’t engage in violence.


Opposition and civil society groups have often accused the Zambian police of bias and violating the constitution after clamping on their rights to free speech and assembly as stipulated in the bill of rights. The groups said the police often use the controversial Public Order Act to suppress their meetings and their planned demonstrations against unfavorable government policies. They also said the police are to blame for the ongoing inter-party violence because of the preferential treatment they give governing PF supporters.


But the Zambia police say the Public Order Act underscores the importance of groups and political parties coordinating their planned activities with the police to ensure there is peace and stability. The law, police also say, regulates the holding of public processions or demonstrations.


“People don’t really understand the provisions of the Public Order Act. This law is actually very good when well followed and observed ... You will find that there are some political parties that would not give the necessary notification period … You find that at times they will notify you two days before the day,” said Chanda, adding that the intent of the act is to forestall violent protests.


“As Zambia police, we are also ready to apprehend and take to court all the perpetrators of violence. We are not just concentrating on political violence but also any forms of violence,” she said.

            <title>Unusually Widespread Flooding Across Louisiana, Mississippi</title>
            <description>As the Leaf River rose north of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, 26-year-old Rebecca Bruce and her fianc&#233; grabbed what they could and left the shed where they live. The water was more than 2 feet deep indoors when they left, she said.


&quot;We lost everything,&#39;&#39; Bruce said Saturday. &quot;I&#39;ve got a book bag full of dirty clothes, and I was lucky to get that.&#39;&#39;


Bruce was among about 20 people in a Red Cross shelter in the Forrest County Community Center on Saturday, as creeks and rivers continued to rise after torrential rains pounded the Deep South. It was one of nine shelters open in Mississippi and 24 in Louisiana.


Downpours — part of a system affecting Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee and Alabama — submerged roads and cars, washed out bridges and forced residents to flee homes.


At least three people have died in Louisiana alone. Mississippi officials were still looking for two missing fishermen, but had no reports of injuries or deaths, said Lee Smithson, head of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, or MEMA. A Hancock County sheriff&#39;s deputy was hospitalized after his patrol car skidded into a ditch Friday night, but is now recovering at home, Chief Deputy Don Bass told the Sun Herald.


MEMA reported major damage to 95 homes, minor damage to 277 others, with reports still coming in from 41 of the state&#39;s 82 counties.


Smithson said Mississippi is dealing with the most widespread flooding since Hurricane Isaac dumped more than two feet of rain throughout the state.


However, he said, &quot;It has not been quite as rough a day as we thought it was going to be today. ... It looks as if the significant rainstorms for the Mississippi Gulf Coast have not materialized.&#39;&#39;


Officials had been afraid that as many as 1,000 homes might flood in Forrest County, where the Leaf River is expected to crest Sunday at 29.5 feet. But on Saturday, Smithson said, the number likely to be affected was looking more like 100 to 150. About 75 raised fishing camps in Pearl River County, across from Slidell, were likely to be surrounded by water, he said.


It&#39;s the most widespread non-hurricane flooding the Louisiana National Guard has ever dealt with, said Col. Pete Schneider, a guard spokesman. He said about 1,000 soldiers and air crews were at work in 25 of Louisiana&#39;s 64 parishes.


By Saturday morning, he said, National Guard crews in 160 high-water vehicles and 44 boats had rescued more than 2,100 people and nearly 190 pets. Others had given out 582,000 sandbags. Floods closed highways across north Louisiana, along its western edge and across the southeast, according to a map on the state Department of Transportation and Development website.


&quot;We have seen flood events in this state but never from one tip of the state to the next,&#39;&#39; Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser told WDSU-TV.

            <title>Some Republican Vietnamese Americans Say No Vote for Trump</title>
            <description>One of the most politically active Asian-American communities says many of its members will not vote if real estate mogul Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee for president.


Vietnamese-Americans are one of the most politically engaged, and many of them who arrived in the U.S. as refugees have been strong supporters of the Republican party.


”We used to see [the] Republican party in the United States as the party that is very anti-communist because of the foreign policy,” said Le Khac Ly, who was a colonel in the South Vietnamese armed forces.


Vietnamese community


Le now lives in Orange County, Calif., where he is part of the largest Vietnamese community outside of Vietnam.




The fall of Saigon to the communists prompted Le and his family to flee Vietnam. They resettled in the U.S. Ever since Le became a U.S. citizen, he voted for a Republican in every election.


This presidential election however, he says, is different.


Trump&#39;s nomination would be &#39;terrible&#39;


“This is unique. [It is] the first time I [have] witnessed … and oh … it’s terrible. I don’t know how to describe it. It is something I can’t imagine is happening,” Le said.


Le said he is disappointed and worried about the future of the U.S. if Trump wins the White House bid.


“If he becomes president, the first thing I can see is the United States are losing more friends in the world. Instead, the United States will have more enemies,” Le said.


“If Donald Trump becomes the candidate for U.S. president and gets elected to the White House, I think it’s going to impact the United States&#39; standing negatively in the world on an international stage,” said Hugh Tra who is a part of the younger generation of Vietnamese-Americans who are affiliated with the Democratic Party.




“The Republican side has been looking like a circus. I think it’s been an entertainment show, a reality TV show, and the millennials I think don’t appreciate because we have real issues impacting us,&quot; Tra said.


He said regardless of party affiliation, the Vietnamese community is turned off by Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric, proposing to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and calling undocumented immigrants from Mexico criminals and rapists.


”We’re immigrants. I’m an immigrant. My family’s refugees and the tone and the rhetoric that’s coming out of the Donald Trump camp make it difficult for even conservatives in the Vietnamese community to want to be a part of this election cycle and be engaged,” Tra said.


Le said some Vietnamese-Americans who have loyally voted for a Republican will not vote at all if Trump becomes the Republican nominee. As for Le, he said he will leave his ballot blank.


Support for Trump


But half a world away in Vietnam, the take on Trump is very different.


Here, an unexpected Southeast Asian fanbase reckons Trump&#39;s anti-China rhetoric might somehow stop &quot;Beijing expansionism&quot; in the South China Sea, where Vietnam has overlapping territorial claims with the world&#39;s most populous nation.




Listener Nguyen Dinh Thieu told VOA’s Vietnamese Service he hopes the billionaire would take military and economic measures to weaken China, &quot;calm the disputed waters&quot; and &quot;bring back islands&quot; allegedly taken from Vietnam.


Many Vietnamese nationals are interested in the U.S. foreign policy position regarding the disputed, resource-rich sea lanes, said Nguyen Manh Hung, a George Mason University professor of international affairs.


“The majority of Vietnamese are frustrated with China’s aggressive moves, so it is not surprising to see they support a U.S. presidential candidate who takes a harsh and intolerant stance against China,” said Hung, an expert on U.S.-Vietnamese relations.


Hanoi hasn&#39;t commented on Trump’s vows to “bring jobs back” from Asian nations, including Vietnam, but the state-controlled Thanh Nien daily newspaper called his comments “shocking.”

            <title>Afghan Insurgent Group Says It Is Ready for Peace Talks</title>
            <description>An insurgent group fighting alongside Afghanistan’s Taliban has said it is ready to join political reconciliation talks with the Kabul government, despite being deeply skeptical about peace intentions of the other side.


Afghan President Ashraf Ghani last week renewed his offer of&#160;negotiations to all insurgent groups in his bid to seek an end to the devastating war, now in its 15th year.


The United States, China and neighboring Pakistan have all welcomed and backed Ghani’s move, though the mainstream Taliban faction has rejected the offer.


&#39;Prepared to participate&#39;


But in a statement released to media on Sunday, the Hezb-e-Islami (HIG) faction led by fugitive Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, said it has accepted the government’s offer and is “prepared to participate in the talks to show to the [Afghan] nation it wants peace.&quot;







An Afghan national unity government spokesman, Javed Faisal, welcomed the announcement.


&quot;It is an important and good news because Hezb-e-Islami has&#160;for years been fighting the Afghan government,&quot; Faisal told VOA. He urged other armed opposition groups to join the talks to help end the war.&#160;


A senior HIG official also told VOA on condition of anonymity that a two-member team has also been formed for the negotiations. It includes the group’s central council chief, Qazi Hakim Hakim, and head of its political affairs, Ghairat Baheer, a son-in-law of Hekmatyar.


The insurgent group has accused the United States of trying to sabotage Afghan peace efforts. It cited last week’s&#160;U.S. State Department announcement in which two senior HIG members were designated as global terrorists for their roles in deadly attacks in Kabul, including a bomb blast that killed six Americans.


The Obama administration has identified the two men, Abdullah Nowbahar and Abdul Saboor, as explosive experts for the militant Hezb-e-Islami.




&#160;


It also offered rewards of up to $2 million for Nowbahar and up to $3 million for Saboor for information leading to their whereabouts.


The designation of two Hezb-e-Islami members as terrorists and offering millions of dollars reward for their arrest at a time when President Ghani has invited the group for peace talks show that Washington is not willing to end its war in Afghanistan, the Afghan insurgent group alleged in Sunday&#39;s statement.


It also blamed certain elements within the Afghan government for opposing peace efforts, but did not elaborate.

            <title>Rivals Blame Trump for Violence at His Political Rallies</title>
            <description>Political rivals of Donald Trump, the leading U.S. Republican presidential contender, are blaming him for sowing the seeds of anger that has erupted in violent confrontations at his political rallies in the last few days.


Fights and pushing and shoving have broken out between his supporters and protesters opposing his candidacy at rallies in several states where key Republican nominating primary elections are set for Tuesday.


Authorities have arrested a small number of protesters, some inside his rallies in Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio and others outside on nearby streets.


One of his opponents, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, called the escalating turmoil at Trump’s campaign stops “frightening and grotesque.”


WATCH: Campaign supporters, protesters clash at weekend events







Rubio blamed Trump’s rhetoric, with the billionaire real estate mogul calling for his supporters to “punch the crap” out of protesters and saying he would pay their legal bills if they are charged by police.


“This is reckless and dangerous,” said Rubio, Trump’s main challenger Tuesday in the southeastern state of Florida, where Rubio lives and Trump has a lavish resort home.


“You just can’t say anything you want as a president or as a presidential candidate. Every day it’s something new,&quot; he said.


Fellow Republicans


Trump’s other two Republican challengers, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich, as well as the two Democratic presidential candidates, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, all blamed Trump, a political novice and one-time television reality show host, for the marked turn toward physical confrontations at his political rallies in recent days.




“People are catching on to Trump, that’s why he’s getting reckless,” Sanders told CNN on Sunday. “Trump is primarily the cause of it. He’s got to tone it down.”


But Trump told the network that “professional disrupters” linked to Sanders’s campaign were to blame for Friday night’s confrontation in Chicago at a rally that Trump called off amid mounting security concerns.


Trump said he “should have gotten credit” for acting responsibly in postponing the event.


No organized protest


Sanders said some of his supporters had disrupted the Trump event, but that his campaign played no role in organizing the anti-Trump protest.


At one Trump rally outside Dayton, Ohio on Saturday, a protester charged toward the stage where Trump was speaking in an airport hangar. But Secret Service agents guarding Trump intercepted the demonstrator before he reached the candidate.


At one Trump rally last week in the mid-Atlantic state of North Carolina, a 78-year-old Trump supporter sucker-punched a protester as security guards escorted the demonstrator out of the gathering.




The Trump supporter was charged with assault, with Trump telling NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday that the man “got carried away.” Trump said he had instructed his aides to look into paying the man’s legal fees to handle his court case.


All of Trump’s Republican challengers have pledged to support him if he wins the party’s presidential nomination at the Republican national convention in July, after the end of the state-by-state nominating contests.


Wavering on commitment


But both Rubio and Kasich say they are wavering in their commitment should Trump get the nomination.


“I think a significant number of Republicans will not vote for Trump,” Rubio said, if the New York developer is the party nominee in the November national election, quite possibly against Clinton, the leading Democratic candidate.




Rubio said, “It’s getting harder every day to justify” his pledge to support Trump if he wins the Republican presidential nomination.




Cruz, a conservative agitator in the halls of Congress against both Republican and Democratic leaders, said Trump “would be a disaster” in a general election matchup against Clinton.


The party primary elections and caucuses are apportioning delegates to the Republican and Democratic national conventions in July, where the presidential nominees will be formally selected. Trump and Clinton both are leading the races for their party nominations, but neither is close to the majority of convention delegates needed to claim victory.


Until now, all the state nominating contests in both parties have split the awarding of delegates roughly along the lines of the vote counts in each state.


But on Tuesday, in both Florida and Ohio, the winning Republican contenders will collect all the delegates, 99 in Florida and 66 in Ohio, in winner-take-all primaries.


Trump has been leading Rubio in Florida, but is locked in a close race in Ohio with Kasich, who governs the Midwestern state.


Clinton and Sanders will continue to collect pledged convention delegates roughly based on their vote totals in each state, not winner-take-all.

            <title>World Champion Go Player Finally Defeats Google&#39;s AI Program</title>
            <description>The world&#39;s reigning champion Go player has redeemed himself with his first win over Google&#39;s artificial intelligence program Sunday after three straight losses.


South Korean grandmaster Lee Sedol defeated AlphaGo in Seoul in the fourth game of the best-of-five series involving the ancient Chinese game.&#160; The computer program clinched the $1 million prize after Lee lost the third game in the match Saturday.


The 33-year-old Lee, who has won 18 international Go titles, was greeted with rapturous applause when he arrived for his post-match news conference, telling reporters he had never before been congratulated just for winning one game.


He was far more somber Saturday after losing the third match, apologizing for what he described as a &quot;powerless display,&quot; while acknowledging that he had &quot;misjudged&quot; the computer program&#39;s abilities.


&#39;Valuable&#39; loss


Demis Hassabis, the head of Google&#39;s DeepMind team, which developed AlphaGo, said Lee&#39;s win Sunday was a &quot;valuable&quot; tool to help it figure out the program&#39;s limitations.


Many top Go professionals commented after AlphaGo&#39;s initial wins that it displayed unorthodox, questionable moves that initially befuddled humans, but made sense in hindsight.


Google, which put up the $1 million prize, said the money will be donated to charity.


Go, which originated in China more than 2,500 years ago, is a complex game with an almost incalculable number of move options. The game involves two players who take turns placing black and white stones on a grid-shaped board. The winner is the player who manages to seal off more territory.


The most famous AI victory to date was in 1997 when the IBM-developed supercomputer Deep Blue beat then-world class chess champion Garry Kasparov.

            <title>Probe of Germanwings Crash Sees Need for Closer Oversight of Pilots</title>
            <description>French aviation investigators said the co-pilot of the Germanwings jetliner who crashed the plane in the French Alps last year had been referred to a psychiatric clinic just two weeks before deliberately killing all 150 people on board.


The findings by BEA&#160; (Bureau d&#39;Enqu&#234;tes et d&#39;Analyses), the French authority responsible for safety investigations into accidents or incidents in civil aviation, were included in a report issued Sunday, more than a week before the first anniversary of the March 24, 2015 tragedy.


The agency found that 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz had consulted several doctors about ongoing psychological issues in the months before the crash -- none of whom reported Lubitz&#39;s condition to either aviation authorities or officials at Germanwings.


Preliminary findings show that Lubitz had told the flight school for Lufthansa, the corporate parent for its budget carrier Germanwings, in 2009 that he had a &quot;serious depressive episode,&quot; but Lufthansa certified him as fit to fly.




The BEA report cited a &quot;lack of clear guidelines&quot; in Germany&#39;s regulations over when a threat to public safety outweighs patient confidentiality.


Investigators are urging aviation bodies to mandate that all pilots undergo regular mental health checkups to detect any problems.


Lubitz crashed the Airbus A320 plane into a mountainside near the French village of Le Vernet during a flight from Barcelona, Spain to Dusseldorf, Germany. He was alone in the cockpit, having locked out Captain Patrick Sondheimer when the senior pilot when to the restroom. &#160;


Sondheimer could be heard on the plane&#39;s &quot;black box&quot; recorders frantically demanding Lubitz to open the door as it was making its final descent. &#160;

            <title>Germany&#39;s Merkel Readies for Backlash at Polls Over Migrant Policy</title>
            <description>German Chancellor Angela Merkel prepared for a backlash at the polls Sunday over her migrant policy as Germans voted in three regional elections.


The anti-immigration, right-wing party Alternative for Germany (AfD) was expected to do well in the largest elections since the country opened its doors to a more than a million migrants last year.


More than 12 million Germans are to vote in the southwestern states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate, as well as eastern Saxony-Anhalt in the so-called Super Sunday polls.


&quot;There is only one path, a Merkel unity path, and people want an alternative, they want a real opposition and we want to take on that task,&quot; Andre Poggenburg, AfD leader in Saxony-Anhalt in former East Germany, told Reuters news agency after voting.


The election is seen as a referendum on Merkel&#39;s leadership.


&#39;Litmus test&#39;


Duesseldorf University political scientist Jens Walther told the French news agency AFP, &quot;These elections are very important ... as they will serve as a litmus test for the government&#39;s disputed policy&quot; on refugees.


In national polls taken shortly before the vote, Merkel&#39;s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its junior coalition partner Social Democratic Party (SPD) was seen losing support, while the populist AfD was gaining and was expected to pick up support in all three states.


It would be a huge blow if Merkel&#39;s CDU fails to win at least two of the three states -- Merkel is trying to use her status as Europe&#39;s most powerful leader to reach an agreement between the European Union and Turkey to stem the flow of migrants.


Merkel has been under growing pressure to close Germany to migrants -- many of them Syrians, and others, fleeing war -- but she has refused to impose a cap on the number of arrivals. She is pushing, through the EU, a European-wide action that calls for distributing refugees among the EU&#39;s 28-member bloc on a proportional basis.


Some material for this report came from Reuters and AFP.

            <title>Robots, Humans’ New Best Friend During SXSW</title>
            <description>R2-D2, C-3PO and Rosie from the Jetsons have interacted with humans, in fiction, as one of our own for decades. Siri talks directly to the user and sometimes it can be mischievous and sarcastic.


If you think a world in which robots interact with humans is in a galaxy far, far away, you are dead wrong.


For years, the robot community has worked to develop artificial intelligence, an integral part of achieving a real interaction between machines and humans.


This year, during the inaugural installment of Robot Ranch, part of the South by Southwest Interactive festival, the robot Jibo left many speechless.




“Unlike your iPad or your tablet, you don’t poke him. You interact with him from a social angle,” Jonathan Ross, head of SDK of Jibo told VOA. “He interacts with you using voice, using gesture, using expression. He can read expressions in your face.”


Jibo is almost 28 centimeters tall and a little more than two kilograms. It looks like an appliance but it couldn’t be farther from it.


Face, expression recognition


The robot recognizes faces and addresses its owners by name.


If it’s raining outside, Jibo will recommend you to take an umbrella. During a birthday party, Jibo tracks action around him and can snap candid pictures and videos when he sees people smiling.


When you’re cooking, Jibo can read the recipe for its owner. The robot is connected to the Internet so it can also order a pizza if ordered to do so. Their creators call it the “world’s first family robot,” a companion of sorts.


Jibo’s team argues technology needs to be humanized.




“Technology is cold and flat right now and bringing personality to it, bringing the way we interact with technology closer to how we interact with each other I think is going to be huge,” said Ross.


But even though Jibo was not the only robot in the room during the inaugural Robot Ranch, he was the most sophisticated one.


The creator of the robot, Cynthia Breazal has studied social robotics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for years. But this doesn’t mean that scientists are the only ones that can build robots.


Other companies are concentrating in developing easy and accessible robot construction platforms that can be used even by children.




&quot;In the current market is very hard to find solutions. The parts are not that easy to use,&quot; said Yukin Pang, spokeswoman for Makeblock, a company that develops educational kits for children that instruct them how to build their own robots.


Tomorrow’s generation


Many parents brought their young children to Robot Ranch in the sprawling Palmer Center in Austin, Texas, to check out the latest advancements the android community.


Kids were completely mesmerized but it didn’t stop there. Many parents used the children’s’ interest in these devices to possibly propel a career in the field.


Dozens of parents were overheard telling their children that if they enjoyed what they saw maybe they could make it themselves.
